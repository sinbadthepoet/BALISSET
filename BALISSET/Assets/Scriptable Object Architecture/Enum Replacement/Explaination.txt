This should be used for things like Damage Types, etc. These can hold more data than a simple enum value for the damage type.

Consider Rock Paper Scisors:
- Create a ScriptableObject Class for each damage type.
- Give it a list of things that it does damage to.
- Dynamite! Add a new type to the game, and we can say it damages all existing types.

All this while avoiding writing new code!
